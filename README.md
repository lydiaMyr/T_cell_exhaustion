# Integrative multi-omics analysis of the tumor microenvironment reveals a CDH11-associated dual program underlying T cell exhaustion in colorectal cancer
## Highlights
1.CDH11 is identified as a novel, multi-cellular regulator of T-cell exhaustion in colorectal cancer, functioning synergistically through both tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts.

2.An integrated dual-mechanism model reveals that CDH11 orchestrates a CAF-driven fibro-metabolic program and a tumor-intrinsic proliferation program to promote exhaustion.

3.Targeting CDH11 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to disrupt the immunosuppressive niche and overcome immunotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer.

4.The study provides a new framework for understanding stromal-immune crosstalk, positioning CDH11 as a central node coordinating chronic antigenic pressure and physical barrier formation.
